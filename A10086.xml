            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT honorable my ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar good Ladie, I can write no pleaſant thinges, the which the great ſtates much deſire, neither anie eloquent termes which this world doth require: but as your honour doth know my rude ſimplicitie (yet through Gods great mercie alwaies grounded vpon his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible veritie) it pleaſeth your honour to giue me leaue ſometimes to write vnto you. And now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing gathered ſome profite my ſelfe, by a booke of that excellent man Theodore Beza, written in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and dedicate to my most honorable Lord: ſo am I bold to put foorth ſome part of the ſame into Engliſh, which I thought most expedient for you, and to preſent it to your honour with this ſhort pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. The which though it be ſhort and rude, yet do I beſeech your honour to conſider it, as a preparatiue to moue your godlie mind to the more diligent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
<pb facs="tcp:2387:3"/> of theſe Arguments of the Pſalmes, which are verie profitable, and to this Paraphraſis, which is a briefe and a plaine declaration of the meaning of the holie Ghoſt, who did endite the Pſalmes, and ſet them foorth by his ſecretaries, Dauid and others, as ſhal appeare in their places. First then I beſeech your Honour to conſider the ſtate of our time, and compare it with former times, that we may ſee what is like to come vpon vs, vnles we do watch and pray, and bring foorth the fruites of vnfeigned repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. We do reade in the histories of the Kings of Iudah, who were the deare people of God, how that after the death of Manaſſes, that idolatrous and cruel King, who had brought in idolatrie againe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that his father Hezekias had reformed religion, Amon reigned but two yeares, when God in mercie ſtirred vp good Ioſias, who restored the religion, and brought it againe to ful perfection, and made a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant betwixt the Lord and the people, and al the people ſtoode to the couenant, <hi>2.</hi> Kings. <hi>23, 3.</hi> the which true religion was continued <hi>31.</hi> yeares, euen al the time of Ioſias, yet is it written in the <hi>2.</hi> Kings <hi>23.</hi> verſes <hi>25, 26, 27.</hi> Like vnto Ioſias was there no King before him, that turned to the Lord with al his heart, and with al his ſoule, &amp; with al his might, according to al the lawe of Moſes, neither after him aroſe there anie like him. Notwithstanding, the Lord turned not from the fearcenes of his great wrath, wherewith he was angrie againſt Iudah, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of al the prouocations wherewith Manaſſes had prouoked him. Therfore the Lord ſaid, I wil put Iuda alſo out of my ſight, as I haue ſent away Iſraël,
<pb facs="tcp:2387:3"/> and wil caſt off this Citie Ieruſalem, which I haue choſen, and the houſe whereof I haue ſaid, My name ſhal be there. Againe <hi>2.</hi> Kings <hi>24.3.</hi> Surelie by the commandement of the Lord came this vpon Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, that he might put them out of his ſight, for the ſinnes of Manaſſes, according to al that he did, and for the innocent bloud that he ſhedde (for he filled Ieruſalem with innocent bloud) therefore the Lord would not pardon it. The which terrible words and threatnings againſt Gods choſen people, when I read them, they cauſe me to tremble and feare for our ſtate here in England. And I do earneſtlie requeſt your honour, and al that feare God, diligentlie to meditate theſe and ſuch like places of the holie hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, which I omit for breuitie ſake. For beſides that our religion is not yet brought to ful perfection in theſe <hi>22.</hi> yeares (the which thing I feare wil be laid to our charge) the horrible ſinnes of former times are not yet purged with true teares of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. For manie do yet carie their idols in their hearts, manie do waite for the occaſion to ſhew the like crueltie that they did before: few do feele how horriblie they did offend Gods ſacred maieſtie in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of idols, contrarie to Gods holie comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, eſpecialie in kneeling downe and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that wafer cake, the vileſt and weakeſt idol that euer was imagined vpon the earth, both for the ſmalnes of the ſubſtance, and the huge heapes of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours therein maintained. The moſt part make that their reuolting vnto Antichriſt, and renouncing of the Goſpel of Chriſt in Q. Maries time, but a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter. Two or three or none, do worthily lament
<pb facs="tcp:2387:4"/> their fal with Peter. Wherefore I can not but feare I ſaie, leaſt the like puniſhment wil come vpon vs for the like ſinnes committed in the daies of Q. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, for al our outward ſhew of religion, as came vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Iudah for their former ſinnes committed in the time of Manaſſes. Therefore haue we great cauſe to praie vnto the Lord our God to be merciful vnto vs, to our Queene, and Countrie: that ſo by earneſt praiers, either we may turne awaie his fearce wrath from vs altogither, or at the leaſt with our Hezekias (our gratious Queene I meane) to obteine that it come not in our daies.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe is this Booke of the Pſalmes moſt neceſſarie for euerie Chriſtian, not to reade them for faſhion and cuſtome onlie, either in a knowne or vnknowne language, which were to take the name of God in vaine: but to meditate them in their hearts, and ſo by earneſt and continual inuocation and hartie praiers to moue the Lord our God to mercies, as his holie ſeruants haue by the like meanes alwaies found mercie before vs. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as al other ſcriptures do teach vs what God ſaith vnto vs, theſe praiers of the ſaints do teach vs, what we ſhal ſaie vnto God, and how we muſt prepare our ſelues to appeare before his maiestie, both in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie and aduerſitie: and therefore are they dailie to be vſed with great reuerence and humilitie. And ſurelie theſe Arguments, &amp; this Paraphraſis of the pſalmes, ſet forth of late by that great learned man Beza, do ſo liuelie paint forth the zealous and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent praiers, which both the whole Church genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and the ſaints of God particularlie haue vſed
<pb facs="tcp:2387:4"/> from time to time, that we haue great cauſe to praiſe God, that hath giuen vs ſuch patternes and examples at this preſent, to ſtirre vp our dul hearts to the ſenſe of our ſinnes, to feare Gods iudgements, and to ſeeke for mercie betimes. And if it pleaſe God to giue vs this grace, thus to do vnfeignedlie, and without al hypocriſie, of this are we ſure, that though we can not turne awaie the general plagues that are threatned and ſeene to hang ouer England: yet that al we that can be ſtirred vp with like affections with theſe ſaints of God, our fathers and brethren of old, to vtter our miſliking and loathing of our owne ſinnes, and of the ſinnes of the people, and ſo ſeeke for Gods mercies, ſhal be marked to ſaluation, when the plague commeth, as God himſelfe hath promiſed. Ezekiel, <hi>9.</hi> Yea, though the peruſing of theſe Pſalmes can worke no more in vs, but to cauſe vs to conſider how far we are from that zeale of Gods glorie, that deſire of building his houſe, that comfort of his word and ſacraments, that vprightnes of life, that faith, hope, and patience in afflictions, that was in Dauid and the other ſeruants of God, that made theſe Pſalmes, and ſo bring vs to ſome more earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and longing for the ſame vertues: yet wil they be verie profitable vnto vs, to be diligentlie read and wel weighed in our mindes. And theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Paraphraſis giuing the true ſenſe of the pſalmes in ſo plaine words (as no man hath done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) wil greatlie further vs to ſuch godlie medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Now as the latine Pſalmes of Beza belong to my moſt honorable Lord by right, as dedicate and ſent vnto him from farre: ſo theſe engliſh Pſalmes
<pb facs="tcp:2387:5"/> tranſlated at home by one of your ſeruants (who is wholie my Lords and yours in the ſeruice of the great Lord) do by as good right pertaine to your honour, who but by ſome ſuch meanes of tranſlation can haue ſmal commoditie of the others, although you haue ſome propertie therein, becauſe it is my Lords your husbands, to whom if mine old forworne rude ſimplicitie, vnfit for this fine world could haue brought forth anie thing worthie his honour, I would not haue bin ſo long ſilent. But I humblie beſeech both your honours to take thus in good part this poore mite, as that of the widowe, which did testifie hir great good wil in a right ſmal matter. And as I am moſt bound, I wil praie for you both, that God our merciful father, for his Chriſtes ſake, would vouchſafe to graunt you to reade the Pſalmes of Dauid, and to meditate them by the ſame ſpirit with Dauid, whereby ye may feele true comfort in al troubles of mind and bodie, as did Dauid, and ſo in the end be crowned in the heauens with Dauid, and reigne for euer with Chriſt our ſpiritual Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid in euerlasting glorie, Amen.

<pb facs="tcp:2387:6"/> our nation) ſeeing that euerie congregation hath not a ſufficient paſtor to explane and interprete theſe Pſalmes, (as alſo other places of ſcripture) with liuelie voice of man (the principal and chiefe way that ought to be in the Church to edifie the conſcience, and to build the faith,) therefore the Tranſlator receiuing this Booke, which was come from farre, euen from a ſtrange Countrie, and in a language vnknowne to the multitude, he was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued none otherwiſe than as a louing friend is wont to impart to his louers that thing, which he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth may be profitable to manie, and ſo ſet forth in our vulgar ſpeach that thing wherof otherwaies they that haue greateſt neede, ſhould haue reaped the leaſt commoditie, in ſo much as now euen the ſimpleſt poore man for a ſmal peece of monie, may by diligent reading in this Booke of that rare man THEODORE BEZA, atteine to a better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of theſe holie Pſalmes of Dauid, than in old time (by the report of the ancient) the great learned men were able, by the peruſing of manie of the great Doctors of the Church. Further, ſith we ſee this alſo by dailie experience, that what ſo euer we knowe, whether it be in flieng newes tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this or that matter, whereof mans mind is ſo deſirous, or elſe euen in the Artes and Sciences which are gotten by great exerciſe and long pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, a man taketh a little or no pleaſure in them, ſo long as he keepeth them to himſelfe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no man priuie to them: but ſo ſoone as he vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth them to others whome he loueth, then his ioy and pleaſure increaſeth, and he accounteth his owne knowledge ſo much the greater, the more that he hath participated it vnto other. Euen ſo this Tranſlator, hauing viewed this Booke through out, could not be ſilent, but receiuing ſo great comforts himſelfe thereby, tooke in hand (God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thereto good ſucceſſe) to make it manifeſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb facs="tcp:2387:6"/> to the common ſort, that they might al reioice together in the Lord, hauing found ſo precious a iewel, which hath afore time bene hid from our forefathers, and is in our daies reuealed vnto vs by the goodnes of God. And he thinketh his labour wel beſtowed, and his knowledge and comfort greatlie augmented, and aboundance of fruite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounding to himſelfe, if his godlie purpoſe be wel accepted, that is, if it be generalie receiued, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerentlie embraced (as by right it ought) of them of whome chiefelie in his trauel he had reſpect. Now as concerning the matter that is tranſlated, we neede not ſpeake manie words, it of it ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plentifullie garniſhed with moſt heauenlie ſentences, as with moſt precious margarites, and furniſhed with al things neceſſarie, either for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction touching this preſent life, or for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to the world to come, is ſufficientlie able to commend it ſelfe to the godlie Reader: onelie this I ſaie, that whereas there be two ſpecial kinds of explaning the Scriptures, one in long Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, another by Paraphraſis, that is, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the ful ſenſe and meaning of the holie Ghoſt in other words, as briefelie as may be, this later is verie ancient (as we may ſee by that moſt ancient Chalde Paraphraſt, who ſeemeth to haue written before anie of the Hebrew Rabbines) and moſt ſafe to certifie the conſciences, when euerie thing appeareth plainelie to anſwere the verie text and original, and muſt needes be moſt profitable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it giueth that matter in few words, which manie times can not be learned by long Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries. Therefore I do exhort you, good Chriſtian Readers, deepelie to conſider, and thankefullie to receiue this Paraphraſis of that great and godlie learned man THEODORE BEZA, as a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Booke for the vnderſtanding of the Pſalmes. So ſhal both your owne knowledge rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

                  <p>Although this Pſalme doth containe a thankeſgiuing, yet for the most part, it is of doctrine and instruction, and hath alſo a ſingular propheſie, concerning the aboliſhing of the old couenant, and of the office of Christ: therefore Dauid, by his example, doth teach vs theſe things. First, that the efficacie and force euen of our praiers, which are
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2387:48"/> heard of God, are deferred, the which doctrine is neceſsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in the contention that faith hath with distrust and impatience. Secondlie, that this deferring, turneth both to the glorie of God, &amp; our owne commoditie. For ſo it is made more euident to al men, out of how great dangers, the Lord doth deliuer his ſeruants: and alſo, this is made more certainlie manifest, how farre they are deceiued, who either being drawen awaie through euil examples, or being ouercome by impatience, do fal fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that we must attribute this, that we are heard of God, and deliuered from dangers, to no ſacrifices of the law, nor ſatisfactions of our owne, but to the free recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation in Christ alone, which was then to be fulfilled, when Dauid wrote this, but is now wholie fulfilled, and finiſhed: and therefore we are heard, not that we ſhould take libertie to ſinne by the mercie of God, but rather that we ſhould conſecrate, and offer vp our ſelues who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vnto him, both before him, and before men, openlie and without al diſſimulation and hypocriſie. Fourthlie, that this chaunge doth not proceede from vs, but is wrought in vs, by the grace of God, who pearceth our eares, to make vs perceiue his word, and worketh in vs, both to wil, and to doe. Fiftlie, that the written lawe of God, is the onlie rule of true obedience. Sixtlie, ſeeing that in this life, there is continuallie a certaine inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable courſe of temptations, we must ioine with our thankeſgiuing for preſent benefites, praiers against miſeries which may hereafter followe: and we must doe our diligence, that being confirmed by the experience of things that are past, we may wholie depend vpon him. And foraſmuch as Dauid was a figure of Christ, Chriſt himſelfe is brought in, ſpeaking in the <hi>6, 7,</hi> and <hi>8.</hi> verſe, and testifieng, that he was made of his father our priest, not to offer the ſacrifices of the lawe: but that by offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelfe, he might finiſh the old figures, and being obedient to his father, euen to the death of the croſſe, he might be vnto vs perfect righteouſnes and redemption, as the Apostle teacheth abundantlie, Heb. <hi>10, 5.</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2387:48"/> But we must remember, that theſe things are ſo to be attributed to the perſon of Christ, that they are to be applied farre otherwiſe to Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than to Dauid, that is, to the truth it ſelfe, and the figure: this onlie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, that Christ, especiallie in his agonie or conflict, did beare in deede our perſon, and therefore he that is our redeemer, in as much as there was no ſinne in him, ſo may he be ſaid the first that is redeemed of himſelfe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as our ſinnes were laid vpon him.</p>

                  <p>This is a most greeuous temptation, which was the occaſion of the making of this Pſalme, treating the ſame matter with the booke of Job, wherein this question is handled, to wit, whether (ſeeing God is iust, and al the miſeries wherevnto men are ſubiect, doe come for our ſinnes) we may determine of the wrath of God, and of the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of anie, by the preſent miſeries wherewith they are oppreſſed. For it is the common iudgement of the world, ſuppoſing of the contrarie, that they are in Gods fauour, which doe abound with the commodities of this life. And both theſe are falſe, as God himſelfe doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the controuerſie betweene Job and his friendes: and Salomon alſo, in his booke called Eccleſiaſtes. Now this temptation is most greeuous, for it openeth the doore to blaſphemie and desperation: and this euil iudgement is the more greeuous, when it proceedeth from faithleſſe and churliſh perſons, of whom chiefly we looked for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Thus was Dauid maruellouſlie vexed of them, who liked not his ſincere and vpright dealing, and ſeueritie
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2387:50"/> of diſcipline, as it appeareth by the historie, that the ſon was drawen away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his father, by the practiſe of wicked Achitophel, and others, and driuen to that horrible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie. Moreouer, theſe faithles perſons had an horrible diſeaſe in their hearts, which increaſed the deſire of alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in them: for they ſuppoſed, when Dauid ſhould be taken awaie, that they could raiſe vp one, who would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their lustes, and would ſet them at more libertie. Dauid therefore greeued with ſo manie ſorrowes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth himſelfe a ſinner, and both by faith resting vpon God, and vpon an vpright conſcience towardes theſe traitors, flieth vnto God, and wiſheth wel vnto them that had a better opinion of him, and powreth foorth most feruent praiers for the ſafetie of himſelfe, and his kingdome: of the good iſſue whereof he is ſo ſure, (as he might wel be, hauing a particular promiſe of God) that he giueth thanks for the performance of the ſame.

                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>This is alſo a Pſalme of praier, but ful of moſt grieuous la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, the authour whereof is ſuppoſed of manie, not to be Dauid, becauſe theſe complaintes ſeeme not to belong to his time, therefore other do refer it to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time: but I do thinke, that that which is ſpoken in the <hi>18.</hi> verſe, and afterward, doth much leſſe agree to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie time, than to thoſe times, which came after Dauid, and the ſlaughter of his people. I therefore rather ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that it was written of Dauid, and euen in thoſe times that were betwixt the death of Saule, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing of Dauid in Hebron. For the Philistins being at that time conquerours, and ciuil war being raiſed vp, though Dauid behaued himſelfe verie moderatelie: yet it is manifeſt, that the affaires of the Jſraëlites were verie ſore vexed, and no doubt, manie captiues were caried awaie from ſundrie places, and ſold: and yet the historie doth not record, that anie thing was then changed in religion. But the circumstance of this time doth maruelouſlie commend Dauids faith, and his mind, for the establiſhing of the kingdome of God, not thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of himſelfe alone, but inditing theſe praiers for the whole Church. And as concerning the matter it ſelfe, this Pſalme teacheth vs that, which we ought especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to knowe, that is to ſaie, that the Croſſe is annexed with the doctrine of Chriſt crucified, not for the trial of this or that man alone, but alſo of the whole bodie of the Church, as the <hi>22.</hi> verſe of this Pſalme is recited of the Apostle, Rom. <hi>8.35.</hi> Although then, that to ſuffer for righteouſnes ſake, is a ſure testimonie of our conformitie
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2387:53"/> and likenes with the ſonne of God, for the which Chriſt commandeth vs to reioice: yet ſeeing we are not iron hearted, but the ſame Chriſt doth bid vs to ſuffer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the priuate afflictions of our brethren, and much more in the publike calamities of the Church, it is neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that our faith ſhould then chieflie be kindled to prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by powring out ſobs and ſighes into the boſome of our father, of the which praier, this Pſalme ministreth vnto vs a moſt notable example. For it is an other thing to murmur againſt God, as vniuſt and deceiueable (as they vſe to do, which receiue the promiſes of God after a ſort for their owne commoditie) than to do as he doth, not as one particular man, but as the whole Church, declaring and acknowledging the benefites of God alreadie recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that we may determine, though theſe inferiour things be changed, yet God wil alwaies remaine like himſelfe constant, and that we ſo complaine both of the crueltie of the enimies, and of theſe alterations, that we ſtil remaining in faith, take occaſion thereby to praie ſo much more earnestlie.</p>

               <argument>
                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>This whole Pſalme is altogether allegorical, and hath the ſelfe-ſame argument, that the ſong of Salomon hath: but I cannot conſent vnto thoſe, which thinke it to be the marriage ſong of Salomon, and the daughter of Pharao. For, beſides that the Hebrue inſcription or ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle would not haue omitted that: I ſee, that that marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is plainlie and worthilie condemned of the holie Ghost, <hi>1.</hi> Kinges. <hi>11.</hi> ſo that, me thinketh, it is a great abſurditie, to ſuppoſe that it was a figure of ſo great a matter. And that ſame ſpiritual coniunction of Christ and the Church, is in this Pſalme most diuinelie deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by an allegorie borrowed of common marriages, the which the prophets afterward haue oftentimes opened, and Paule himſelfe, Rom. <hi>7.2.</hi> Cor. <hi>11.</hi> and Epheſ. <hi>5.</hi> But we muſt marke, that as in marriages among men, firſt contracts are made, and then the marriage celebrated: ſo Chriſt, the husband of the Church, is to be conſidered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort in a two-fold ſtate, that is, in a ſtate of weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which we may compare with the contractes: and in the ſtate of glorie, which he obteined after his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, being now the true and the glorious husband of the Church, euen though it continue as yet in part vpon the earth: and in this Pſalme he is ſet forth as glorious, and that hath entered in marriage with vs. Chriſt therefore is that King, the husband of the Church, than whome there is nothing more beautiful, as he that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth al blemiſh. And what the force of this perſuaſion is, it doth not onlie appeare in entiſing, but alſo in chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging mens minds through the preaching of the Gospel,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2387:55"/> and the vnspeakable power of the ſame. The ſame Chriſt, in aſmuch as he is man, receiued the ſpirit, not in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but moſt abundantlie, ſo that it redoundeth to al the ſainctes: he hath a ſword giuen him, not for osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, like an vnſenſible idol, but that he muſt drawe it forth, and this is it that pearceth to the ſeparation of the ſoule and of the ſpirit. Alſo, he is furniſhed with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, wherewith he ſtriketh through al his enimies: wherefore exceeding praiſe and ſingular excellencie, both in preſeruing his children, and in confounding the proud, is by good right due vnto him. Againe, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he is brought in, carried vpon three horſes, to wit, the truth, meekenes, and righteouſnes, which are gouerned of the word, as of the onlie directer of the courſe: for the declaration of the which moſt diuine alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie, according to the weightines and worthines of the matter, we had neede haue a whole booke. But by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie this may brieflie be vnderstood, if a man do conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how the kings and princes that are led by a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſpirit are wont to be carried f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r otherwiſe, not vpon horſes, but vpon moſt ſauage and cruel beasts: namelie, ambition, arrogancie, fiercenes, crueltie, riot, and horrible oppreſſion of ſubiects. And we muſt carefullie note that which foloweth, that howſoeuer the world doth impeach and ſlander this gouernement, being both moſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and moſt moderate: yet this iuſt King ruleth al things prosperouſlie, and the more he is reſisted, the more he ſheweth forth his power, both in that ſo iuſt, and ſo ſafe defence of his poore flocke, and alſo in wounding his enimies to death, inwardlie by his heauenlie power: that is to ſaie, when he giueth them vp into a reprobate ſenſe, ſo that they become the instruments of their owne destruction. And though al theſe things do fal out dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, whiles this King defendeth al his elect, that none of them do periſh, and reuengeth their enimies, as pleaſeth him: yet that which ſeemeth here to be noted, appeared plainelie in the verie beginning of this mariage, that is ſolemnized in deede, when as he did terriblie puniſh the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:2387:55"/> thankeles ſynagogue with thoſe rods that as yet endure: but yet preſeruing a remnant of his elect, through a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rare mercie, which he vſed towards ſo rebellious a ſtocke of Abraham. Hauing now gotten the victorie, this King is placed in his throne, the which is ſaid to be eternal, that it might be ſignified not to be of this world, not onlie becauſe (as Salomon ſaith) iustice establiſheth the ſeate of a king, but alſo for that this King is both the true and the eternal God, and the verie ſonne of Dauid according to the fleſh: &amp; to whome, in that he is placed aboue euerie name, euen in that he is man, al power is giuen both in heauen and in earth, as this verſe is cited. Heb. <hi>1.8.</hi> ſo that neither there are more kings, (for that one wife can not haue manie husbands) neither yet is he ſo to be vnderstood God, that he is not man: (for thus he were no meete husband for this Church, which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth of men) neither alſo is he man in ſuch ſort, that he is not the eternal and verie God: for then the Church ſhould not haue one husband ſufficientlie able to defend it. After this, the moſt holie gouernement of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that is to ſaie, of the Church, is added: for the Church of God alone is ruled by the true rule of moſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right gouernement, in al publike and priuate vocations, becauſe there the ſpirit of God reigneth, instructing the iudgement of the godlie, and brideling their affections. And the cauſe of this ſaieng, which foloweth, is verie weightie, to wit, that this King (both concerning his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie perſon, and alſo the heauenlie gifts) is annointed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue his felowes, that is to ſaie, he is exempted out of the number of other kings. For the moſt excellent kings, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Dauid himſelfe, was infected with manie and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſinnes: but in this King nothing at al is wanting. Finallie, thoſe things that are ſpoken of his moſt preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous apparel, do partlie belong to the voice of his father, <hi>In whom I am wel pleaſed,</hi> wherein is ſignified, that the father was reconciled vnto vs, both by the perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie of the perſon of our Immanuel, and likewiſe by this moſt ſweete ſmelling ſauour of his obedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There was alſo another chiefe end of the ceremonies, (that is, of the outward worſhip) that they might behold in them, as in a certaine table, both the guiltines of their owne ſinne, and alſo the promiſes of taking away ſinne, which ſhould be perfourmed in Christ: and ſo being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, ſhould continuallie remember their dutie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, what they did owe vnto God, and what vnto their neighbours. None therefore, did more abuſe the outward worſhip of the lawe, than they that dreamed that they had wel done their dutie, if they had diligentlie obſerued thoſe outward ceremonies, neglecting their chiefe end. Therefore doth the Prophet Aſaph reprooue this most wicked errour (which the Phariſies afterward did most ſtubbernlie defend) in this moſt diuine and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Pſalme: the which thing alſo afterward the other Prophets did not ceaſe to inculcate: and he bringeth in God vſing most ſtrong arguments, both from his owne nature, and from the condition of thoſe things which were offered vnto him. And this doctrine is to be retei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Church of God alwais, becauſe men common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſtumble at this stone. But chieflie it is neceſſarie for this our time, in the which, not onlie that old errour is restored, whereby the ſacraments are transfourmed into

                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>This Pſalme was then written of Dauid (as the Hebrue title doth declare) when he was most ſharpelie rebuked of the Prophet Nathan, for that his most horrible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie, ioined wi h manſlaughter, as is witneſſed, <hi>2.</hi> Sam. <hi>12.</hi> Jt is one of the principal Pſalmes of Dauid, conteining a notable example of repentance, which must go before remiſſion of ſinnes. I ſaie it is notable, whether thou respect the perſon it ſelfe of Dauid, or elſe his ſinne, or lastlie the verie matter, that is, euerie part of repentance. For first, here is ſet foorth vnto vs an example of a most mightie King, and of a most holie Prophet, &amp; ſuch a one, who (as much as anie man could) had wel deſerued of the Church, euen to this end, that we ſhould learne, that kings haue none other God, than poore men haue: and the higher that one is in authoritie among men, the more euident and infamous is his ſin, &amp; for that cauſe he must labour the more carefullie, to giue vnto other an example of repentance. But now concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him, of whom here we haue to ſpeake, I knowe not whether (h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uing conſideration of the circumstances of Dauids perſon) any monument be extant of ſo many &amp; heinous crimes proceeding out of one fact: whereof we perceiue how great weaknes there is, euen in the best, &amp; most excellent men: and againe we learne, what excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:2387:64"/> mercie the moſt gratious and moſt mightie God doth ſhew to euerie one that do repent. But if we carefullie pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that which is the principal point, I can not tel whether euer there were anie example heretofore of ſuch a repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. For, as concerning the inward acknowledging and abhorring of the ſinne, which they cal contrition, J ſee not what can be required as wanting in it: ſith Dauid confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that he was guiltie of eternal damnation, euen from the firſt moment of his conception, and moſt exquiſitelie ſearcheth forth al the circumstances of his offence: ſo farre is he from ſeeking anie excuſes to couer it, and from drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of anie recompence for his deſerts. But if we conſider the outward confeſſion of the ſinne (which is another part of true repentance, the which commonlie they confound with ſatisfaction) what a rare example is this of ſo great a king, and ſo worthie a Prophet? that laieng aſide al humane respect, either of his roial maiestie, or priuate reputation, did not onlie ſuffer the ſtorie of that his crime to be put in writing: but euen he himſelfe wrote a perpetual testimonie of his acknowledging of the fact, thereby to ſatisfie the whole Church. For the holie man knew that we muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of ſinne, not of repentance, or turning from ſinne: and that a skarre that is ſeared, or a blot that is printed in vs by ſinne, is not increaſed by ſuch a publike confeſſion as is made before the Church, but rather is cured vp and taken awaie. Dauid ſo farre differeth from the deintie men of our age (that had rather beare anie thing, than the yoke of this diſcipline and gouernement) that though he were a king of great power, yet he willinglie ſubmitteth himſelfe vnto it. Finallie, the commoditie of true repentance doth here alſo moſt euidentlie appeare, in that God doth neuer forſake thoſe that are truelie penitent: but contrariwiſe turneth euen their verie ſinnes, both to his glorie, and their amendement and comforts. And there are ioined in this Pſalme alſo two principal pointes of true religion: the one, of original ſinne: the other, of the abuſe of ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: as though the purgation of ſinne conſisted in that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ceremonie, whereas on the contrarie part, the ſacrifices
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2387:65"/> that proceeded from vnpure men, did not pleaſe God, and therefore forgiuenes of ſinnes muſt go before, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhould be ſealed in the hearts of the beleeuers, by the ſacrifices which are made and offered by faith.</p>

For it ſhould rather haue bin gathered by that ſame principle, that we muſt determine otherwiſe of the ends of good and euil things, than men vſe to do, becauſe God doth bestowe, euen vpon euil men, certaine commodities: his prouidence is not therefore aboliſhed, but rather his infinite goodnes and patience commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

Finallie, which is the chiefeſt of al, that it ſhal neuer go wel with the euil men, and that by their owne fault. Contrariwiſe, that it ſhal neuer go euil with the good, and that by the ſingular mercie of God. For vnto the euil men, good things are turned to euil: and on the contrarie, vnto the good men, euen euil things turne to good. This is a verie pretious doctrine, which is handled oftentimes both in other Pſalmes, and in diuers places of the ſcripture, especiallie in Job, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Abacuc, but aboue al in this Pſalme: the which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Aſaph worthilie ſaith, that it muſt be ſought onlie in the ſanctuarie of God: whereas bare, ſlender, and ſometime fooliſh things are taught in the ſcholes, of the difference of good and euil things, and of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and of their cauſes and effects, euen among thoſe Philoſophers, which did count vertue their onlie meede, and did iudge onlie the wiſe man to be alwaies bleſſed.</p>

                  <p>It may be collected by this Pſalme, what maner of ſermons the Prophets made in the Church of Jſraël, when the histories were declared in their ſynagogues. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie this ancient monument of the holie antiquitie is to be had in great reuerence, as certaine other Pſalmes alſo, and the ſermon of Stephen in the Actes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and that ſermon of Paule made at Antioch,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:2387:96"/> Acts. <hi>13.</hi> And hereby we learne alſo, with what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite we may reade the holie histories, which are ſet forth vnto vs in this Pſalme after two ſorts: to wit, to bring vs into a deepe conſideration of the constancie of God, alwaies continued in the performing of his promiſes: and of the other ſide, of his wrath against the obstinate and ſtubborne breakers of his couenant. The Prophet then doth declare this, by this long and diligent rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, both of the chiefe benefites, which God hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon this people, euen from the first adoption and chooſing of them, euen vnto Dauid, and alſo of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments which the people cauſed God, euen as it were vnwillinglie, to execute vpon them. And would to God, that al men could marke in their minds, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie this doctrine is in our times: and how woonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful examples God hath ſet before vs to both theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, by the ſpace of theſe fortie yeeres, euen as great as euer before.</p>
